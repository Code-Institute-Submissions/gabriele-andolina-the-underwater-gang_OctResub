# **Wireframes**

## **An Introductory Note**  
  
I had to scale down the project during its development. In an effort to adopt an Agile mindset, I focused on delivering a MVP in the form of a properly functioning blog while leaving the individual *About Us* page and the logbook app to a future release. <br>
This document includes all the original wireframes, with an indication of those now belonging to a future release.
