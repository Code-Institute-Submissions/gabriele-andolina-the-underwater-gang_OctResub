# **Wireframes**

## **1. Site Map**

## **2. Homepage**
In the final version of the project I decided to remove "About us" as a separate section and to make it a blog post instead. It can be found, with the same name, in the blog section. I have also decided to welcome users with a simple image and welcome message, providing the sign in and sign up functionalities through the links in the navbar.

## **4. Blog Post**
The first version of the website was created according to the wireframes attached. After completion, however, I was not entirely satisfied with the general outlook of the post page, so I decided to move the like and comment icons below the post's title and to increase the comment form and section to occupy a single row each. I believe this has improved the general feeling of the page, making it cleaner and easier for users to browse through.

## **5. Logbook**
The final version of the project differs from the attached wireframes in that I chose to separate the list of logged dives and the form to log a new dive into two different pages. The first one has thus come to be the logbook's main page, cleanly and simply listing all logged dives, which can be accessed upon click. The form to log a new dive can, instead, be accessed by clicking the logbook top page button or the link in the navbar.
